  <div id="desc">The Stanford bunny is a computer graphics 3D test
    model developed by Greg Turk and Marc Levoy in 1994 at Stanford
    University. The bunny consists of data describing 69,451
    triangles determined by 3D scanning a ceramic figurine of a
    rabbit. This model and others were scanned to test methods of
    range scanning physical objects.</div>
